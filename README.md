OPEnumerable
============

This define some methods on `NSObject` that are applicable only to objects conforming to the `NSFastEnumeration` protocol. These methods are very similar to the ones defined in Ruby's [Enumerable module](http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Enumerable.html#method-i-find).

Another project doing something similar is [BlocksKit](https://github.com/zwaldowski/BlocksKit/), but the usage of [A2DynamicDelegate](https://github.com/pandamonia/A2DynamicDelegate) scares the crap out of me, so I decided to re-implement most of the methods directly, and more simply.

##Installation

We love [CocoaPods](http://github.com/cocoapods/cocoapods), so we recommend you use it.
